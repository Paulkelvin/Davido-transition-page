                <h2 class="about-heading">About Davido</h2>
                <p class="about-paragraph">David Adedeji Adeleke (born November 21, 1992),
                    popularly known as Davido, is a Nigerian-American singer, songwriter,
                    and record producer. Davido rose to fame after releasing "Dami Duro",
                    the second single from his debut studio album Omo Baba Olowo (2012). In 2012, 
                    Davido won the Next Rated award at The Headies. Between 2013 and 2015, he 
                    also released a number of hit singles and in January 2016 he signed a record
                    deal with Sony Music. He then founded the record label Davido Music Worldwide (DMW),
                    to which acts Dremo, Mayorkun, Peruzzi and Liya have been signed. In July 2016, Davido
                    signed a record deal with Sony' RCA Records. In October 2016, he released the 5-track EP
                    Son of Mercy, which was supported by the singles "Gbagbe Oshi", "How Long" and
                    "Coolest Kid in Africa". 
                    In April 2017, Davido re-negotiated his contract with Sony due to creative control issues
                    and later that year he released five singles including "If" and "Fall".
                    "If" generated worldwide social media activity while "Fall" became the longest-charting
                    Nigerian pop song in Billboard history.</p>
